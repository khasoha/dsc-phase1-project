## Overview
This is an analysis of movie data sets from imdb that should offer insight to a client ('Microsoft') on what films to create based on which ones 
are doing best in the BoxOffice

## Business Problem

Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. We are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. We must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.




## Data

The Imdb datasets offer a range of information that includes movie genres,their titles, unique movie IDs,years of production, runtimes, ratings, studio of production, viewer votes and gross income(foreign and domestic)


## Methods

Descriptive analysis because it helps us understand and summarize the basic characteristics and patterns present in the data. These datasets contain information about movies, including their ratings, genres, runtimes, and number of votes. Descriptive analysis allows us to gain insights into the overall distribution and trends within the data, providing a foundation for further analysis and decision-making.

## Results

Movies with the highest recorded votes have a rating of between 5 and 7.5 Most famous titles are under the genre of Action, adventure, sci-fi per votes
The findings reveal the diversity of genres that attract viewer attention. Different genres cater to different audiences, and genres with a significant number of votes demonstrate higher audience engagement. 
Highest earnings are from the foreign markets though the domestic market proves to be relatively steady over the years


## Conclusions

Microsoft can focus their attention by first creating movie genres with the most famous titles and have the most votes 
The foreign market recorded the highest gross income over the years
The runtimes should ideally be 75minutes and above.

Next steps
Better categorize movies as the “no category” genres were significant as well which can help boost popularity.
Capture more of the domestic market to boost overall gross income
